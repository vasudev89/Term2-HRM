### Performance Management
#### Param Venkatesan's belief:

##### Quarterly Reviews 
	- Conducted Every Quarter
	- Supervisor to review direct reports
	- 3 to 4 quantifiable metrics
	- Subjective measures also used
##### Stack Ranking
	- Forced Distribution System
	- Forcibly assign a rank to each employee
	- Top 20% = A, Next 70% = B, Remaining = C
	- Min 10 Emps needed for execution
	- Applied horizontally to all emps at the same level
	- Implications:
		- A's
			- Cash Rewards - upto 25% of Salary
			- Stock Options vested over the a 3 year period - upto 50% of Salary
		- C's
			- Forfeit bonus and options grant
			- Additionaly subjected to PIP - Given reasons by manager + remedial action provided
			- Failure to comply could lead to termination
			- 60% PIP Emps left the company
##### Upward Feedback Surveys(UFS)
	- Employee to rate supervisor by filling a survey
	- At the end of each quarter
	- Parameters:
		- Professional and Technical Skills
		- Interpersonal and Communication Skills
		- Credibility and Integrity
		- Teambuilding
		- Leadership
		- 5 Pt Likert Scale Used for each parameter
	- Supervisor will receive an average of scores
	- Supervisor's boss will also receive a copy
	- Received all the way up to the CEO

### Contentious Issues
#### Decisions on:
	- Trent Raynor - UFS Score's below standard
	- Gwen Davidson - C rating in Stack Rating

#### Trent Raynor
- 2011 - Manager of Aadapted Tech Group
- 120 Subordinates
- Joined Consumer Innovations in 2008 - Sales Job
- Suggested a new system for generating online ad revenue
- Performed well in 1st 2 Quarters in UFS
- Final Quarter UFS Scores had fallen on all parameters
- PIP for Wagner - a colleage from the Sales Job __Reason for Bad UFS__
- Raynor younger than Wagner

##### Wagner
- Late for Work
- Leaving Early
- Disengaged
- Affecting Team - hurting Morale
- Some were thinking of shifting base
- Raynor's predecessor took no action leading to 4 employees leaving

Raynor didn't want a similar fate
- Confronted Wagner
	 - Wagner surprised
	 - Agreed to improve
- 2 weeks later -> No improvement
	- Explained that it would lead to a C Rating
- In November Wagner gathered his team, apologized, and promised to improve
- Raynor was appreciative via an email


##### January Review by Raynor
- Quarterly Review
- Wagner met 2 out of 3 - A milestone deadline
- Stack Ranking Not Necessary - Raynor had only 4 Reportees
- Yet he gave a rating of C
- Wagner not happy
	- Implication: He will make his views clear in the UFS Evaluation

#### Gwen Davidson
- Tom Goldstein had given Gwen Davidson a C Rating in Stack Rating
- Chung knew that she had suffered a personal loss
- Decision: *Continue with C Rating* or *Upgrade to B*

- Joined in 2011 as TL
- Problems:
	- Formal Demeanour
	- Rigid Work Habits
	- Tendency to Micro Manage
	- __Against the creative process of her team of 13 reports__
	- Team Perspective: Incompatible with Team Ethos and Threat to Success

- Skip meeting of Team with Goldstein
	- She's Emotionally volatile
	- Lacked Passion for Work

##### Davidson's Confrontation with Goldstein
- Goldstein:
	- Justification for low rating:
		- Product Launch Delay
		- Several Areas where she fell short of Expectations
		- Aware of her personal circumstances
		- Personal Feelings or sympathies cannot influence assessment
		- If he moved her out of a C rating, someone else would have to fill in

#### Mark Albright(MA) - Head of Security Solutions Group
- Sydney Office
- Ex-military
- Headed Security Solutions Group
- Demanding and No nonsense kind
- Consistent 'A' performer
- Strong Professional and Technical Skills
- Good Communicator
- Made his expectations known

##### Colin Kerr
- MA expected 20% revenue growth from him
- No use arguing with MA
- Had to submit the UFS on Mark Albright - His boss
- Had only scored MA less than 5 on *Receptive to suggestions and feedback*
- Difficult to answer the questions on Teambuilding and Leadership
- One answer obvious - freedom to operate
- Other 6 questions problematic
	- Teambuilding
		- Fosters a congenial but competitive culture
		- Builds constructive Relationships
		- Is responsive to employees concerns
	- Leadership
		- Recognizes and rewards excellence
		- Supports and develops others
		- Is personally committed to the organization
